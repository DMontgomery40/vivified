# Mobile Settings Fix - Complete

## Problem
The Settings page had major formatting issues on mobile devices:
- Text overlapping and unreadable
- Input fields cramped together
- Help text running into other elements
- Update buttons misaligned
- Overall messy and unprofessional layout

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created ResponsiveSettingItem Component
New reusable component at `src/components/common/ResponsiveSettingItem.tsx` that:
- **Mobile Layout (< 600px)**: Vertical stacking with proper spacing
  - Label and icon at the top
  - Current value displayed clearly
  - Helper text underneath
  - Full-width input fields
  - Touch-friendly controls (44px minimum)

- **Desktop Layout**: Clean horizontal layout
  - Icon, label, and info on the left
  - Input field on the right with proper width
  - Better use of horizontal space

### 2. Created ResponsiveSettingSection Component
Wrapper component for configuration sections that:
- Provides consistent padding and borders
- Handles section titles and subtitles
- Adapts spacing for mobile vs desktop

### 3. Updated Settings Component
Refactored the Settings.tsx to use the new responsive components:

#### PHAXIO Configuration
- API Key field with password masking
- API Secret field with secure input
- Callback URL with proper placeholder
- Help links as clickable chips
- Status icons clearly visible

#### Documo Configuration  
- API Key with password protection
- Sandbox mode selector
- Clean, organized layout

#### SIP/Asterisk Configuration
- AMI Host field
- AMI Password with security indicator
- Station ID with E.164 format help
- Warning icons for insecure defaults

## Key Features

- Clear visual hierarchy

### Security Improvements

### Better UX

- Responsive breakpoints at 600px (mobile) and 960px (tablet)

## Technical Details

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 600px (vertical layout)
- Tablet: 600px - 960px (optimized spacing)
- Desktop: > 960px (horizontal layout)

### Components Structure
```tsx
<ResponsiveSettingSection>
  <ResponsiveSettingItem
    icon={statusIcon}
    label="Setting Name"
    value={currentValue}
    helperText="Help description"

    onChange={handleChange}
    type="text|password|select"
  />

```
