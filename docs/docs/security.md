!!! danger "Security & Compliance â€” Read first"
    These are user-facing security and compliance practices. Operations and developers should follow organizational security controls in addition to these recommendations.

# Security & Compliance Guide :material-security:

Vivified handles PHI/PII and is designed for auditability, encryption, and role-based access. This guide focuses on practical measures for secure use and integration.

## Key Principles

- Least privilege: grant only required roles to users and API clients.
- Encryption: data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
- Audit everything: all access and transformations are recorded.
- Admin Console first: all configuration and secrets must be managed from the Admin Console or a secrets store configured through it.

!!! tip "Role management"
    Use fine-grained roles for operational vs. application access. The Admin Console exposes role bindings and recent assignment history.

## Authentication & Authorization

- API access uses bearer tokens. Rotate tokens regularly and audit usage.
- Use multi-factor authentication for Admin roles where possible.

## Data Protection

- All objects stored in Storage are encrypted. Use the Admin Console to review encryption key rotation policies and access logs.
- Canonical transformations may redact or mask PHI before data leaves the platform.

## Audit & Retention

- Audit logs capture actor, action, object, and timestamp.
- Retention policies are configurable from the Admin Console. Ensure retention complies with legal and organizational policies.

## Integrations & External Providers

- Configure domain allowlists in the Gateway.
- Avoid sending unredacted PHI to third-party providers unless explicitly approved and recorded in audit logs.

!!! warning "Third-party data" 
    Sending PHI outside approved boundaries can violate policy. Use the Canonical Service to mask sensitive fields and add data traits that identify high-sensitivity flows.

## Incident Response (user steps)

1. Immediately rotate any exposed secrets in the Admin Console.
2. Isolate affected plugin(s) by disabling them from the Admin Console.
3. Export relevant audit logs for review.
4. Engage security and compliance teams with the exported evidence.

## Troubleshooting: security-specific

- Unexpected data exposure: Check audit logs to see who accessed the object and when. Verify retention rules.
- Missing audit entries: confirm you have the right role and check system health for the Audit subsystem.
