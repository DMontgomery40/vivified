  "overview": "# Security Service Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe **Security Service** in the Vivified platform provides robust mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with HIPAA regulations. It encompasses TLS configuration for secure communications and encryption utilities for protecting sensitive data such as PHI and PII.\n\n!!! note\n    The security service is designed to be HIPAA-compliant, ensuring that all data transactions and storage adhere to stringent security requirements.\n\n## Architecture\nThe security service consists of two main components:\n\n- **TLS Configuration**: Establishes secure communication channels using SSL/TLS protocols.\n- **Encryption Utilities**: Provides encryption and decryption functionalities for sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[TLS Configuration] --> B[SSL Context Creation];\n    C[Encryption Utilities] --> D[AES-256-GCM Encryption];\n    D --> E[Data Protection];\n```\n\n",
  "api": "# API Reference\n\n## TLS Configuration\nThe TLS configuration is handled via the `tls_config.py` file, which creates a secure SSL context for server communications.\n\n## Encryption Utilities\nThe `encryption.py` file provides an API for encrypting and decrypting data using AES-256-GCM.\n\n### Methods\n\n- `create_tls_context(cert_dir: str) -> ssl.SSLContext`: Creates and returns an SSL context configured with the specified certificates.\n- `HIPAAEncryption.encrypt(data: Dict, associated_data: str) -> Tuple[str, str]`: Encrypts data with associated data for context.\n- `HIPAAEncryption.decrypt(ciphertext: str, associated_data: str) -> Dict`: Decrypts data using the associated context data.\n\n",
  "config": "# Configuration Guide\n\n## TLS Configuration\nThe TLS setup is critical for secure communication between clients and servers. The `tls_config.py` file includes the following configuration options:\n\n| Option       | Description                                |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| cert_dir     | Directory path for certificate files       |\n| ca_cert      | Path to the CA certificate file            |\n| server_cert  | Path to the server certificate file        |\n| server_key   | Path to the server key file                |\n\n!!! warning\n    Ensure that the certificate and key files are kept secure and only accessible by authorized personnel.\n\n## Encryption Configuration\nThe encryption utilities use AES-256-GCM for data encryption. Ensure that:\n\n- Keys are securely stored and managed.\n- Key rotation policies are implemented using a KMS or HSM for long-term storage.\n\n!!! tip\n    Regularly update and rotate encryption keys to maintain security.\n\n",
  "examples": "# Usage Examples\n\n## TLS Context Creation\nThe following example demonstrates how to create an SSL context for secure communications:\n\n=== \"Python\"\n    ```python\n    from tls_config import create_tls_context\n    context = create_tls_context(cert_dir=\"/path/to/certs\")\n    ```\n\n=== \"curl\"\n    ```bash\n    curl --cert /path/to/core.crt --key /path/to/core.key https://secure.example.com\n    ```\n\n## Data Encryption and Decryption\n\n=== \"Python\"\n    ```python\n    from encryption import HIPAAEncryption\n\n    data = {\"patient_id\": \"12345\", \"data\": \"sensitive information\"}\n    encryption_instance = HIPAAEncryption()\n    ciphertext, tag = encryption_instance.encrypt(data, \"12345\")\n    decrypted_data = encryption_instance.decrypt(ciphertext, \"12345\")\n    ```\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Ensure all data is transmitted over secure channels.\n- Use strong, random keys for encryption.\n- Regularly audit and update security configurations.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- **Problem**: Failure to load certificates.\n  **Solution**: Verify the certificate paths and file permissions.\n\n- **Problem**: Decryption errors.\n  **Solution**: Ensure the correct keys and associated data are used for decryption.\n\n- **Problem**: SSL handshake failures.\n  **Solution**: Check SSL/TLS versions and cipher configurations for compatibility.\n\n!!! note\n    For further assistance, refer to the official documentation or contact support.\n\n"
